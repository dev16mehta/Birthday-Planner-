The goal of this small project is to implement a program that generates a personalised itinerary for a friend’s birthday.

The day will include three types of activities: main activities (such as an escape room), cafe stops, and restaurants. 
For personalisation, it takes an input word (e.g. a person’s name) as its argument and creates a list of activities in which the first letter(s) of each item spell the given word!
